	 *
	 * In most modern browsers, when the document enters a hidden state, the Request Animation Frame and setTimeout, which
	 * control the main game loop, will automatically pause. There is no way to stop this from happening. It is something
	 * your game should account for in its own code, should the pause be an issue (i.e. for multiplayer games)
