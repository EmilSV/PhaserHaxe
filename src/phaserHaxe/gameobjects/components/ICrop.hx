	 * Applies a crop to a texture based Game Object, such as a Sprite or Image.
	 *
	 * The crop is a rectangle that limits the area of the texture frame that is visible during rendering.
	 *
	 * Cropping a Game Object does not change its size, dimensions, physics body or hit area, it just
	 * changes what is shown when rendered.
	 *
	 * The crop coordinates are relative to the texture frame, not the Game Object, meaning 0 x 0 is the top-left.
	 *
	 * Therefore, if you had a Game Object that had an 800x600 sized texture, and you wanted to show only the left
	 * half of it, you could call `setCrop(0, 0, 400, 600)`.
	 *
	 * It is also scaled to match the Game Object scale automatically. Therefore a crop rect of 100x50 would crop
	 * an area of 200x100 when applied to a Game Object that had a scale factor of 2.
	 *
	 * You can either pass in numeric values directly, or you can provide a single Rectangle object as the first argument.
	 *
	 * Call this method with no arguments at all to reset the crop, or toggle the property `isCropped` to `false`.
	 *
	 * You should do this if the crop rectangle becomes the same size as the frame itself, as it will allow
	 * the renderer to skip several internal calculations.
	 *
	 * @since 1.0.0
	 *
	 * @param x - The x coordinate to start the crop from. Or a Phaser.Geom.Rectangle object, in which case the rest of the arguments are ignored.
	 * @param y - The y coordinate to start the crop from.
	 * @param width - The width of the crop rectangle in pixels.
	 * @param height - The height of the crop rectangle in pixels.
